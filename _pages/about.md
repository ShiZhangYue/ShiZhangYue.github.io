I am Zhangyue Shi, a PhD candidate at [School of Industrial Engineering & Management](https://ceat.okstate.edu/iem/) with minor in Statistics, Oklahoma State University, advised by [Prof. Chenang Liu](https://ceat.okstate.edu/iem/people/c-liu-faculty-profile.html). I hold a Bachlor in Mechanical Engineering from Xi`an Jiaotong University, China.

Research Interests
------
My research focus on **advanced data analytics**-based quality assurance for smart manufacturing, which invovles the general areal of **machine learning**, blockchain, and sensor fusion.
- **Data quality assurance**: Propose a blockchain-enabled framework to prevent malicious cyber-physical attacks occuring on important data ([stream data](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-abstract/IDETC-CIE2021/V002T02A035/1128437))/files ([G-code](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computingengineering/article/21/4/041007/1089710/A-Blockchain-Based-G-Code-Protection-Approach-for)).
- **Design quality assurance**: Develop an autoencoder-based feature extraction method for [smart machine parameter selection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978921000056).
- **Process quality assurance**: Incorporate [LSTM-autoencoder](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10845-021-01879-9), augmented time regularized genetative adversarial network ([ATR-GAN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9592834)), knowledge distillation (ongoing) to enhance the *in-situ* monitoring performance.
