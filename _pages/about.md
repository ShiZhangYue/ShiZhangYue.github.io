I am Zhangyue Shi, a PhD candidate at [School of Industrial Engineering & Management](https://ceat.okstate.edu/iem/) with minor in Statistics, Oklahoma State University, advised by [Prof. Chenang Liu](https://ceat.okstate.edu/iem/people/c-liu-faculty-profile.html). I hold a Bachlor in Mechanical Engineering from Xi`an Jiaotong University, China. 
My research focus on **advanced data analytics**-based quality assurance for smart manufacturing, which invovles the general areal of **machine learning**, blockchain, and sensor fusion.
- **Data quality assurance**: Propose a blockchain-enabled framework to prevent malicious cyber-physical attacks occuring on important data/files.
- **Design quality assurance**: Develop an autoencoder-based feature extraction method for smart machine parameter selection.
- **Process quality assurance**: Incorporate autoencoder, genetative adversarial network (GAN), knowledge distillation to enhance the *in-situ* monitoring performance.

News
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
